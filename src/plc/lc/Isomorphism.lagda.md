module plc.lc.Isomorphism where
```

This section introduces isomorphism as a way of asserting that two
types are equal, and embedding as a way of asserting that one type is
smaller than another.  We apply isomorphisms in the next sections
to demonstrate that operations on types such as product and sum
satisfy properties akin to associativity, commutativity, and
distributivity.

## Imports

```
import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality as Eq
open Eq using (_≡_; refl; cong; cong-app)
open Eq.≡-Reasoning
open import Data.Nat using (ℕ; zero; suc; _+_)

open import plc.vfp.Relations
```

## Preliminaries

We will use the definition of function composition which we saw in
[the Functional section]({{ site.baseurl }}/Functional/#fnComposition).

```
_∘_ : ∀ {A B C : Set} → (B → C) → (A → B) → (A → C)
(g ∘ f) x  = g (f x)
```

## Equational reasoning for isomorphism

It is straightforward to support a variant of equational reasoning for
isomorphism.  We essentially copy the previous definition
of equality for isomorphism.  We omit the form that corresponds to `_≡⟨⟩_`, since
trivial isomorphisms arise far less often than trivial equalities:

```
module ≃-Reasoning where

  infix  1 ≃-begin_
  infixr 2 _≃⟨_⟩_
  infix  3 _≃-∎

  ≃-begin_ : ∀ {A B : Set}
    → A ≃ B
      -----
    → A ≃ B
  ≃-begin A≃B = A≃B

  _≃⟨_⟩_ : ∀ (A : Set) {B C : Set}
    → A ≃ B
    → B ≃ C
      -----
    → A ≃ C
  A ≃⟨ A≃B ⟩ B≃C = ≃-trans A≃B B≃C

  _≃-∎ : ∀ (A : Set)
      -----
    → A ≃ A
  A ≃-∎ = ≃-refl

open ≃-Reasoning
```


## Embedding

We also need the notion of _embedding_, which is a weakening of
isomorphism.  While an isomorphism shows that two types are in
one-to-one correspondence, an embedding shows that the first type is
included in the second; or, equivalently, that there is a many-to-one
correspondence between the second type and the first.

Here is the formal definition of embedding:
```
infix 0 _≲_
record _≲_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  field
    to      : A → B
    from    : B → A
    from∘to : ∀ (x : A) → from (to x) ≡ x
open _≲_
```
It is the same as an isomorphism, save that it lacks the `to∘from` field.
Hence, we know that `from` is left-inverse to `to`, but not that `from`
is right-inverse to `to`.

Embedding is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric.  The proofs
are cut down versions of the similar proofs for isomorphism:
```
≲-refl : ∀ {A : Set} → A ≲ A
≲-refl =
  record
    { to      = λ{x → x}
    ; from    = λ{y → y}
    ; from∘to = λ{x → refl}
    }

≲-trans : ∀ {A B C : Set} → A ≲ B → B ≲ C → A ≲ C
≲-trans A≲B B≲C =
  record
    { to      = λ{x → to   B≲C (to   A≲B x)}
    ; from    = λ{y → from A≲B (from B≲C y)}
    ; from∘to = λ{x →
        begin
          from A≲B (from B≲C (to B≲C (to A≲B x)))
        ≡⟨ cong (from A≲B) (from∘to B≲C (to A≲B x)) ⟩
          from A≲B (to A≲B x)
        ≡⟨ from∘to A≲B x ⟩
          x
        ∎}
     }
```

It is also easy to see that if two types embed in each other, and the
embedding functions correspond, then they are isomorphic.  This is a
weak form of anti-symmetry:
```
≲-antisym : ∀ {A B : Set}
  → (A≲B : A ≲ B)
  → (B≲A : B ≲ A)
  → (to A≲B ≡ from B≲A)
  → (from A≲B ≡ to B≲A)
    -------------------
  → A ≃ B
≲-antisym A≲B B≲A to≡from from≡to =
  record
    { to      = to A≲B
    ; from    = from A≲B
    ; from∘to = from∘to A≲B
    ; to∘from = λ{y →
        begin
          to A≲B (from A≲B y)
        ≡⟨ cong (to A≲B) (cong-app from≡to y) ⟩
          to A≲B (to B≲A y)
        ≡⟨ cong-app to≡from (to B≲A y) ⟩
          from B≲A (to B≲A y)
        ≡⟨ from∘to B≲A y ⟩
          y
        ∎}
    }
```
The first three components are copied from the embedding, while the
last combines the left inverse of `B ≲ A` with the equivalences of
the `to` and `from` components from the two embeddings to obtain
the right inverse of the isomorphism.

## Equational reasoning for embedding

We can also support tabular reasoning for embedding,
analogous to that used for isomorphism:

```
module ≲-Reasoning where

  infix  1 ≲-begin_
  infixr 2 _≲⟨_⟩_
  infix  3 _≲-∎

  ≲-begin_ : ∀ {A B : Set}
    → A ≲ B
      -----
    → A ≲ B
  ≲-begin A≲B = A≲B

  _≲⟨_⟩_ : ∀ (A : Set) {B C : Set}
    → A ≲ B
    → B ≲ C
      -----
    → A ≲ C
  A ≲⟨ A≲B ⟩ B≲C = ≲-trans A≲B B≲C

  _≲-∎ : ∀ (A : Set)
      -----
    → A ≲ A
  A ≲-∎ = ≲-refl

open ≲-Reasoning
```

#### Exercise `≃-implies-≲` (practice)

Show that every isomorphism implies an embedding.
```
postulate
  ≃-implies-≲ : ∀ {A B : Set}
    → A ≃ B
      -----
    → A ≲ B
```

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `Bin-embedding` (stretch) {#Bin-embedding}

Recall that Exercises
[Bin]({{ site.baseurl }}/Naturals/#Bin) and
[Bin-laws]({{ site.baseurl }}/Induction/#Bin-laws)
define a datatype `Bin` of bitstrings representing natural numbers,
and asks you to define the following functions and predicates:

    to : ℕ → Bin
    from : Bin → ℕ

which satisfy the following property:

    from (to n) ≡ n

Using the above, establish that there is an embedding of `ℕ` into `Bin`.
```
-- Your code goes here
```

Why do `to` and `from` not form an isomorphism?

## Standard library

Definitions similar to those in this section can be found in the standard library:
```
import Function using (_∘_)
import Function.Inverse using (_↔_)
import Function.LeftInverse using (_↞_)
```
The standard library `_↔_` and `_↞_` correspond to our `_≃_` and
`_≲_`, respectively, but those in the standard library are less
convenient, since they depend on a nested record structure and are
parameterised with regard to an arbitrary notion of equivalence.

## Unicode

This section uses the following Unicode symbols:

    ∘  U+2218  RING OPERATOR (\o, \circ, \comp)
    λ  U+03BB  GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMBDA (\lambda, \Gl)
    ≃  U+2243  ASYMPTOTICALLY EQUAL TO (\~-)
    ≲  U+2272  LESS-THAN OR EQUIVALENT TO (\<~)
    ⇔  U+21D4  LEFT RIGHT DOUBLE ARROW (\<=>)
